    "## Problem Introduction\n",
    "As the last question of a successful interview, your boss gives you a few pieces of paper with numbers on it and asks you to compose a largest number from these numbers. The resulting number is going to be your salary, so you are very much interested in maximizing this number. How can you do this?\n",
    "In the lectures, we considered the following algorithm for composing the largest number out of the given single-digit numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is somewhat easy to generate the largest number when the given numbers are all single digited ones. Same algorithm does not work when the numbers in the list consists of different number of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for an input consisting of two integers 23 and 3 (23 is not a single-digit number!) the correct answer is 323 and not 233. In other words, using the largest number from the input as the first numberis not a safe move. Your goal in this problem is to tweak the above algorithm so that it works not only for single-digit numbers, but for arbitrary positive integers.\n",
