## Greedy Algorithm

I started this folder as I was going through `edX`'s `Algorithms & Data Structures` course. The course work was challenging specially I enjoyed solving the homework problems. Very often it forced me to open my data structure books which I studied decades ago. Once the problems are solved I decided to put them in Python notebook so that it becomes handy for reference purposes in future.

My initial approach was to describe the problems in Jupyter notebook as `Latex`. Later I found that workload to be too heavy. So I will upload the PDF file from `edX` describing the problems in this directory. If the reader is currently a student of the same course I will strongly encourage to solve the problems him(her)self rather than looking at the solution.
