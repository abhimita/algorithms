## A-star search algorithm

A* (pronounced "A star") is a computer algorithm that is used in pathfinding and graph traversal. Visualization of the search is done for a graph with 40 nodes using `Pydot` and `Graphviz`

Pythonic definition of the graph can be found [here](https://github.com/abhimita/algorithms/blob/master/graphs/src/helper/map40.py)
