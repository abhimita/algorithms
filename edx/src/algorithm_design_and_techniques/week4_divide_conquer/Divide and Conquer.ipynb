    "### Problem Introduction\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement the binary search algorithm that allows searching very efficiently (even huge) lists, provided that the list is sorted.\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "### Task.\n",
    "The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.\n",
    "### Input Format.\n",
    "The first line of the input contains an integer `n` and a sequence $a_0 \\lt a_1 \\lt ... \\lt a_{n-1}$ of `n` pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. The next line contains an integer `k` and `k` positive integers $b_0,b_1,...,b_{k-1}$.\n",
    "### Constraints.\n",
    "$1 \\leq n, k \\leq 10^4; 1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$ for all $0 \\leq i \\le n$; $1 \\leq b_j \\leq 10^9$ for all $0 \\leq j \\le k$\n",
    "### Output Format.\n",
    "For all `i` from `0` to `k - 1`, output an index $0 \\leq j \\leq n - 1$ such that $a_j = b_i$ or −1 if there is no such index.\n",
    "#### Sample 1.\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "5 1 5 8 12 13\n",
    "5 8 1 23 1 11\n",

    "In this sample, we are given an increasing sequence $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 5, a_2 = 8, a_3 = 12, a_4 = 13$ of length five and five keys to search:8,1,23,1,11. We see that $a_2 = 8$ and $a_0 = 1$, but the keys 23 and 11 donot appear in the sequence `a`. For this reason, we output a sequence: 2,0,−1,0,−1\n"
